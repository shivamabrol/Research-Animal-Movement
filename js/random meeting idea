take an array of captured points
and figure out 

separte trajectories 


in the selected area. 
Histogram binned by time
see if they were multiple 


make time incrementing work first 
and then have a meeting with Rich and Alexander

Extract these points and tell about them


how to sample

burst of samples 
- pull out points too far 

sample on the based of distance - keep a minimum 


can we connect these points to a path. - feed the points to these lines 
see movement lines
